# Install the testnode app on a booted iOS simulator, run a one-line console.log
# via `node -e`, and assert it booted and exited cleanly. Tier 1 smoke
# (doc_mobile/TEST_PLAN.md).
#
# Usage: run-ios-smoke.sh <testnode.app> <simulator-udid>
#
# Retries only the simulator-flake signature: a '<none>' verdict means the app
# launched but wrote nothing (a loaded/sick CI simulator killed it before
# node ran). A 'FAIL' verdict means node ran and the test failed — that is a
# real regression and is never retried, so the retry can't mask a real bug.

# libc exit(), which never returns from node_start, so NodeRunner's post-run
# PASS write is skipped and only the atexit FAIL fallback fires. Letting the
# event loop drain returns 0 from node_start -> a clean PASS verdict.
